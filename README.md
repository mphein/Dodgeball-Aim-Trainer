Dodgeball Aim Trainer

A unity 3D project in the works that is a pseudo aim trainer for first person shooters. This is the foundation of a project for school where the player will be able to shoot moving opponents and get an accuracy assessment.

I hope to add different levels, procedural generation, and enemy AI.

Challenges: Learning the Unity game engine.
Learned: Scene management, physics, collisions, UI, menus.
